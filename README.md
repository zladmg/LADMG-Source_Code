Official Source Code of Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening in 1993

From 2018-2021, a huge wave of Nintendo leaks nicknamed the "Gigaleaks" was posted online which contained 
many top secret infomation ranging from game and console source code to internal documentation 
and development tools. Included within all the mess was the Source Code to The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening
released in 1993 for the Nintendo Game Boy system in every language that it was made in. However, in its raw state 
it is very confusing to set up which this archive fixes. Other then that, all the source code within is untouched 
and produces 1:1 copies of the ROMs which can be changed to your heart's desire. 

The source archive in the leaks is titled XXX__ゼルダの伝説 夢を見る島 split in several numbered folders for each
language, most likely due to space for storing into floppy disks. 

It builds the following ROMs:

- us_v2.gb `sha1: 5ab63def958728933571c3b4f6af54db14f3f8b2`
- jp_v1.gb `sha1: 80f5d111c7e2d79d39f6c25a37b54c3196d2bd12`
- de_v0.gb `sha1: cc468442508a8ba6c4661238aa1925a3132f1630`
